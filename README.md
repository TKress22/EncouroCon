# EncouroCon

.Net framework MVC written in C# and JavaScript in the views, EncouroCon is intended to be a simple self-help app, where users enter info
on how their day was and can interact with a game map that essentially gives them a "daily move" on the game board. Throughout time, stats
are collected on things like what caused their days to be the way they were, allowing them to take a broader look on things that affect
their days, and act accordingly for the future. Or just use the stats for fun, entirely up to them.
